The Yieldstream vault is constructed on the ERC-4626 standard in order to follow the latest standards of the defi space.
As a result the Yieldstream vault structure is highly flexible and allows Yieldstream to stand out from it's competition.

Apart from following the standard ERC-4626 framework the Yieldstream vault design is customised to function through the use of a registered adapter based framework that allows users to deploy their own customised strategies through the use of Yieldstream's registry.

By following the ERC-4626 standard Yieldstream is able to provide a lightweight and cutting edge aggregation protocol that's built to grow alongside the defi space into mainstream adoption. We welcome every curator to give it a go.
