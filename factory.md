The Yieldstream vault factory allows anyone to interact with the Yieldstream registry in the vault deployment process by offering access to Yieldstream supported markets for users that want to interact with the protocol.
Apart from that it also hosts the global adapter registry.

By interacting with the Yieldstream factory and it's blueprint contract users are able to select the markets of their choice for the deployment of their own Yieldstream strategy.

During the vault deployment process users are able to interact with the following parameters:

Markets setup: When deploying a Yieldstream strategy users are able to select the markets of their choice based on their personal discretion.
The market selection can be modified over time based on the vault owner's preferences as the owner is able to add and remove markets on the go.

Fee setup: When deploying a Yieldstream vault users can set up their preferred fees in order to benefit financially from the yield that a vault generates as they are the ones occupied with the selection of markets and liquidity caps.

Minimum apy improvement target: Each Yieldstream vault has a minimum apy improvement target setup that's required for the rebalancing process and which can be modified over time if a vault owner wishes to modify their approach on that front.

Revshare rate setup: Each Yieldstream vault allows it's deployer to set up the revshare rate for the rebalancing process as the strategists that participate in the process will get compensated with this rate on the yield that the vault generates until another strategist shows up with a better allocation.
