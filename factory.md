## The Yieldstream Vault Factory

The Yieldstream vault factory is the gateway for creating personalized yield strategies, enabling users to interact seamlessly with the Yieldstream registry and deploy vaults tailored to their specific needs.
The factory empowers users by providing access to Yieldstream-supported markets and hosting the global adapter registry, all within a streamlined deployment process.

### Key Features of the Vault Factory

**Market Selection**:

- The factory integrates with the Yieldstream registry, allowing users to choose from whitelisted adapters and markets for their vault strategies.
  Users have full control over market configurations and can modify their selections at any time, adding or removing markets as their strategy evolves.

**Blueprint Contract**:

- At the core of the factory is a blueprint contract that standardizes and simplifies the deployment process.
- This ensures a consistent user experience and a robust infrastructure for creating Yieldstream vaults.

### Customizable Parameters for Vault Deployment

When deploying a Yieldstream vault, users can configure the following key parameters to align with their goals:

**Market Setup**:

- Select the desired markets to allocate funds, leveraging personal discretion and risk tolerance.
  Modify the market selection post-deployment as strategies change or new opportunities arise.

**Fee Setup**:

- Set preferred fees to benefit from the yield generated by the vault.
- As the curator of the strategy, the vault owner defines fees to reward their expertise in market and liquidity management.

**Minimum APY Improvement Target**:

- Specify the minimum APY improvement required to trigger rebalancing.
- Vault owners can update this parameter over time, allowing flexibility to adapt to market conditions or refine their approach.

**Revshare Rate Setup**:

- Define the revenue-sharing rate for rebalancing proposals.
- Strategists participating in the rebalancing process are compensated based on this rate for the lifetime of a proposal, incentivizing optimal allocations.

### How It Works

**Access the Registry**:

- Users interact with the Yieldstream registry via the factory to browse and select whitelisted adapters for their vaults.

**Configure Parameters**:

- Using the blueprint contract, users input their preferred market setup, fees, APY improvement target, and revshare rate.

**Deploy Your Vault**:

- Once parameters are set, the factory deploys the vault, linking it to the selected adapters and initiating the strategy.

### Advantages of the Vault Factory

**Permissionless Deployment**:

- The factory is fully open, allowing anyone to deploy their own vault without gatekeepers or admin keys.

**Flexibility and Control**:

- Users can dynamically adapt strategies and market allocations as conditions evolve.

**Seamless Integration**:

- By hosting the global adapter registry, the factory ensures smooth interaction with external markets and protocols.

### Example Use Case

A user deploying a Yieldstream vault focused on stablecoin markets might:

- Select adapters for CBBTC/USDC and ETH/USDC pools from the registry.
- Configure a 5% APY improvement target to trigger rebalancing.
- Set a 10% revshare rate to incentivize strategists.
- Deploy their vault and manage their strategy dynamically as market conditions change

The Yieldstream vault factory is the ultimate tool for DeFi curators, providing the infrastructure and flexibility needed to craft and refine bespoke yield strategies in an ever-evolving ecosystem.
