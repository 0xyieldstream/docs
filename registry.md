The Yieldstream Registry serves as the backbone of the protocol’s adapter management system, providing a centralized yet permissionless framework where whitelisted adapters are registered for user accessibility.
By leveraging the registry, Yieldstream ensures a curated and secure environment for deploying customized vaults, offering users the confidence to interact with a trusted set of adapters.

## Core functionalities of the registry

1. Adapter whitelisting

- Only adapters that meet Yieldstream’s security and functionality criteria are added to the registry.
- This ensures that all adapters available for vault deployment are vetted for reliability, reducing risks for vault deployers.

2. Adapter management

- The registry acts as the definitive source of approved adapters, making it easy for users to browse and select options for their vaults.
- Developers can submit adapters for review and potential inclusion, fostering innovation while maintaining protocol integrity.

3. Integration with the vault factory

- During the vault deployment process, users interact with the registry to select whitelisted adapters that align with their strategy.
- The seamless connection between the registry and the factory ensures an efficient and user-friendly experience.

## Benefits of the registry

1. Security

- Whitelisted adapters undergo rigorous checks to ensure compliance with the protocol’s standards, giving users peace of mind when deploying vaults.
- The registry protects users from malicious or poorly designed adapters that could compromise their yield generation strategies.

2. Flexibility and accessibility

- A growing list of whitelisted adapters provides users with a diverse array of market options to choose from.
- Users can easily customize their vault strategies by selecting adapters that align with their yield and risk preferences.

3. Innovation and collaboration

- Developers can contribute to the ecosystem by submitting adapters for review and inclusion in the registry.

# How to interact with the registry

- During vault creation, users can select one or more adapters from the registry to define their strategy.
- Vault deployers retain the flexibility to update their adapter selection post-deployment through the Yieldstream infrastructure.

The Yieldstream Registry is more than just a catalog of adapters—it’s a hub for innovation, security, and user empowerment, ensuring every vault deployer has the tools they need to succeed in the ever-evolving DeFi landscape.
