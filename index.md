## Introduction

Yieldstream redefines yield aggregation by putting the power back in your hands. Have you ever wondered: What if I could design my own strategy? What if I could truly harness DeFi’s money legos without relying on third-party decisions for my yield generation? What if I had access to limitless possibilities in Ethereum’s ever-expanding ecosystem? Yieldstream is the answer.

With Yieldstream, you can take full control of your yield generation strategies through its flexible, modular infrastructure. By empowering you to create highly customizable ERC-4626 vaults that adapt to your evolving needs, Yieldstream unlocks endless opportunities and lets you curate strategies that reflect your unique goals.

But this isn’t just another yield aggregator. Yieldstream revolutionizes the space with a decentralized rebalancing mechanism and innovative liquidity caps. These features enable granular capital management while leveraging the open market to optimize returns on your behalf via its on-chain revenue-sharing mechanism.

Yieldstream’s fully on-chain rebalancing modernizes yield aggregation by eliminating reliance on off-chain components. Users can submit rebalancing requests to active vaults and earn a share of the generated yield for the lifetime of the proposal, with revshare rates determined by vault owners during deployment.

Vault deployers maintain full control over market selection and can adapt their strategies over time. The liquidity cap mechanism adds an extra layer of control, allowing deployers to limit allocations per adapter, ensuring smarter, safer capital deployment.

In addition, Yieldstream’s invariant framework offers robust security.
By monitoring external markets for anomalies, such as unexpected losses, it acts as a circuit breaker, automatically preventing further deposits and enabling swift fund recovery.

Yieldstream offers a radically new way to engage with yield aggregation.
Whether you’re an experienced strategist or exploring the possibilities of DeFi for the first time, Yieldstream is designed for you.
Launching soon on Morpho’s Base deployment, Yieldstream is fully permissionless: no admin keys, no gatekeepers—just pure DeFi innovation.
